I was thinking of writing something for every day of advent.
But I missed yesterday and now it’s nearly midnight on the second.
The thing that’s coming back to me is the thing about the hierarchy.
This is what I kept saying when I was receiving agile coaching. You can’t use bad news as a way of levelling the status between you and the client
And here we are again.
I wrote the client an email saying that if we were moved off the project it would take a long time to hand over to another team and they would need to be similarly technically skilled.
His response was that we were bound by the contract to provide support after the contract had finished. Ah yes, the perpetual indentured slavery clause. Of course he’s talking nonsense. But it’s status-induced nonsense.
This is the SNAFU principle. I think we’re supposed to know that “SNAFU” stands for something like “situation normal, all fucked up.”
 You can’t have proper communication in a hierarchy because status always gets in the way. That’s Robert Anton Wilson.
But I’m starting to think that instead of talking about absolutes I should be talking about managing contradictions.
“Adequate communication flows freely between equals. Communication between non-equals is warped by second-circuit Domination and Submission rituals perpetuating communication jam and Game without end.”
This is the culture and it’s eating strategy for breakfast.
Contradiction.
In order to realize the ideas that are the origin of a project you have to explore their validity and by exploring their validity you attack the idea.
Contradiction.

In order to do well for the product manager who sits in the hierarchy you have to reveal problems with their performance that will absolutely result in them reasserting the hierarchy. You have to try to talk to them as if nearly on a level, which in itself might result in them insisting on reasserting the hierarchy.
There are lots more of them.
Fear and loathing of contradictions is baked into the idea of commitment and consistency. How can you be consistent, yet at the same time acknowledge contradictions. 
You’re almost always asked to commit to something either when you have the least information that you can make the commitment or the most information that you  absolutely can’t make that commitment.
Contradiction. 
Contradictions. They are embarrassing, difficult to think about. Difficult to talk about. Difficult to talk about and admit within a team let alone with a client. All strategies for dealing with them will have problems and you will feel you’ve done the wrong thing. 
As the great life and soul of any party Soren Kierkegaard said ‘Do it or don’t do it you’ll regret it.’
Contradiction.
The best way for a creative team to do good work is to feel safe. But nobody is really safe. Economies shift. Projects get canned. People at Google developed the idea of the importance of psychological safety for creative teams. Google cans a lot of projects.
The best way to do your job as if you have no fear of losing it. But doing it like that, sometimes seems to result in losing it.  I’ve lost several jobs by behaving like that.
But trying to behave “safely” makes things even worse.
Contradiction.
