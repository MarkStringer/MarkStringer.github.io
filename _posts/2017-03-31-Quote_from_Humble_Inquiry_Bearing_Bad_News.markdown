# Bearing Bad News

>When I talk to senior managers, they always assure me that they are open, that they want to hear from their subordinates, and that they take the information seriously.  However, when I talk to the subordinates in those same organizations, they tell me either they do not feel safe bringing bad news to their bosses or they've tried but never got any response or even acknowledgment, so they concluded that their input wasn't welcome and gave up.  Shockingly often, they settle for risky alternatives rather than upset their bosses with potentially bad news.
