I sent this email - but I might have cocked up at the first step and sent from an email address that tends to go straght to spam folders - or even bounced!


Hello Library Events Team,

I’m writing to ask whether Tower Hamlets Libraries host entry-free author events, and whether you might consider one for a forthcoming book of mine.

My name is Mark Stringer. I’ve been a Tower Hamlets resident for 13 years, and in spring I’m publishing my first book: Delivering the Impossible: Successful Ways of Seeing Software Project Management. The Amazon listing is [here:](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Delivering-Impossible-Successful-Software-Management/dp/B0FVDH4NJV/).

Although the subject is software project management, I’ve developed the material into live, audience-friendly storytelling. I’ve performed two fringe shows on the theme at the Brighton Fringe and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and audiences responded very positively—even when they had no background in software or project management.

I’d love to run an entry-free event at one of your libraries (or Idea Stores), ideally as a 45–60 minute talk + Q&A, with an option to sign books afterwards. I’m very happy to adapt the format for your space and audience, and to fit around your scheduling and accessibility requirements.

If this is something you might be able to host, I’d be grateful to know:

- whether you programme author talks / book events,

- how proposals are assessed,

- who the best person is to contact (or an alternative organisation you’d recommend if it isn’t something you offer).

Many thanks for considering a speculative enquiry—any guidance would be really appreciated.

Yours sincerely,
Mark Stringer
