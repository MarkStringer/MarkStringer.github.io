# What does the 'two-stream' model mean for personal projects?
## (like writing a book!)

So writing and thinking about the successful project that I've just been working on got me thinking about this "two stream" model of project management. There's a virtual value stream (I'm still experimenting with the names for these) and there's a virtuous value stream. The first value stream is the one where you get value from the "idea" of a project, the second one is the value stream where you get value from the *reality* of the product. 

One way of seeing project management is as managing the transition between a value stream which rewards the idea and a value stream which rewards the *reality.*

This is a big idea and I was very pleased with myself when I thought of it, for about five minutes. Then I realised that it also applied to other kinds of projects, like trying to write a book about project management.

Saying that you're going to write a book (and I've done this several, if not dozens, of times) gives you a positive boost. Starting writing the book, similarly, has positive feelings associated with it. Even, as I managed on the previous attempt at a book called "Delivering the impossible." Sharing chapters online can get positive feeback from friends and supporters. But pretty soon after that, the positive reinforcment runs out. The difficulties of expressing the ideas that you've either only explained to yourself, or managed to make sound plausible in a conversation in a cafe or a pub, now have to be commited to paper. And when you hit this plateau, it's *very* easy to give up.

So, I'm going to get back to software development in another post, but for now, let's just think about how I might manage getting a book about software development actually delivered. 

I'm brainstorming now. 

1. Actually get a publishing deal! If someone gave me some money to write the book, that might be an incentive to finish it. 
2. Capture actual progress - how many words written (I do this with my walking and my weight)
3. Deliver something that works early (this is nicked from software development) 
4. Establish a "no matter what" routine (again this is nicked from software development)
5. Work towards a reasonable deadline, or a series of reasonable deadlines.
6. Work at a sustainable pace
