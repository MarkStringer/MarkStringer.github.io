I emailed a couple of bookshops to enquire about doing some kind of book event. 

And in the course of that, I searched for the book on line and found the Waterstones page.

And on the Waterstones page, they've changed the cover!

This is brilliant because the new cover has a skull (no crossbones, but hey - it's still a bit pirate) and it has a martini, a die (like chapter Bet) and best of all, a biscuit.
