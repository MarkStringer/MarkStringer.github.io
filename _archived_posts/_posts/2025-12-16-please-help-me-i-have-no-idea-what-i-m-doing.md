I'm still not quite sure when the book is going to come out. It looks like it's going to be some time in the spring.

I want to give it the most support possible.

Thoughts going through my head. 

Readings in libraries.

Readings in chain bookshops, i.e. Waterstones.

Readings in independent bookshops.

Fringe shows Brighton and Edinburgh.

One-off fringe shows.
