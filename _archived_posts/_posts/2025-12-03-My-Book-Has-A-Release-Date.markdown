# May 25th 2026 - is the release date for my book!

My book is called "Delivering the Impossible."

It's fitting that it's released in May, because it's a series of blog posts that I wrote in May 2016 that got the whole thing started.

I was commuting in London from Limehouse to Uxbridge every day - a commute of about 1 hour 45 minutes.

And so, in the mornings, when I was on the Metropolitan line, with 45 minutes of train ride ahead of me, I thought I'd use the time to write.

Ten years later and after three visits with "shows" to the Edinburgh Fringe, and two visits to the Brighton Fringe, trying explore and explain the ideas in the book, it's finally coming out. 

What are the ideas in the book?

The main ideas is that, if we look at projects from different points of view, we can be much smarter and more successful in the way that we manage them. But there's a second idea - if we look at projects in the *wrong* way - we might end up making ourselves dumber and make a worse job of delivering.

OK, and then there's a final idea. The real kicker. Seeing things in the *wrong* way is actually, for most of us, more tempting. Only when you know what you're doing can you avoid your initial unhelpful intuitions and start to see things in the right way and deliver successfully.
