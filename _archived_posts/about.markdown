![Mark Stringer Author Performer Project Manager](/assets/MarkStringerAuthorPerformerProjectManager.jpg)

My name is Mark Stringer. I want to improve the way we all do project management.

I do this in three ways:

- by managing projects (I still work as a project manager)

- by writing about project management

- by talking and performing

I have worked in the software development industry for 30 years, first as a programmer and applications researcher, and for the last fifteen years as a project manager. I’ve worked for companies such as IBM, Xerox and Cambridge University.

I wrote Delivering the Impossible after a realisation. I seemed to be repeatedly reading the same project management book with different titles. Each claimed that, if you followed a prescribed methodology, everything would be lovely. My experience was that, whatever methodology you used, things very often weren’t.

In recent years, alongside writing this book, I have written and performed one-man shows — Delivering the Impossible and The Biscuit Tin and The Biscuit — at the Brighton and Edinburgh Festivals.

I have an honours degree in philosophy from the University of St Andrews, Scotland.

I am married and live in London, England and Thessaloniki, Greece.

My hobbies are learning Greek, joke writing and looking for my slippers.
