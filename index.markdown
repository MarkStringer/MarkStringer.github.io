### Mad shit that happened on a recent project

#### Part 1: Saying what everyone is thinking

We were at big-room planning. People had actually travelled there in person. Everybody was there. Everybody apart from the two or three people who were actually going to write the code. They weren't invited.

The thing that everyone was talking about—everybody that I was talking to anyway—was the interim solution. The interim solution used COTS software. There was this idea that a lot of the possible customers (the customers were businesses) wouldn't initially be able to use the bespoke online solution. They wanted the reassurance that they could use something that they already had on their desktop.

But what I was hearing was that user research had run into a problem with the interim solution. Maybe the sole traders wanted this solution. But our user research showed that the SMEs weren't going to use it. They had security policies. It wouldn't get past their email filters. They didn't want it running on their machines.

This is what I'd been hearing all day.

I should have known.

When it came to the wrap-up and the product owner asked me if I wanted to do the summary...

I should have known.

"Well, the main thing that's come out of today is that the interim solution is dead."

I probably shouldn't have said "dead."

But it was dead.

Everybody in the room, to a man and woman, including the ones who all day had been telling me that the interim solution was dead, acted as if, rather than mentioning the elephant in the room, I had just unveiled an actual live elephant!!! And not like a well-trained elephant balancing on a beach ball. No, a wild bull elephant with massive tusks that was screeching and ready to charge.

"What? The interim solution is dead?"

"How can you know it's dead?"

Maybe that screeching sound wasn't from the bull elephant; it was the sound of the people who'd been telling me all day that the interim solution was dead slamming their opinions into reverse.


"Nobody said it was dead!"

"What are you talking about?"

"We can't say that just yet!"

"We need more data."

I felt ever so slightly exposed. 

Only one user researcher came to my aid. She stood next to me and said, "I think what Mark means is that our research indicates that the interim solution won't work for a substantial proportion of our users."

But the damage was done. Management was furious. They had told a lot of people that the interim solution would work. They didn't want to hear that it wouldn't. They wanted "more data" to show that it wouldn't.

Collect all the data you want. It's still dead.

What's the simplest way of explaning my book?

[![Delivering The Impossible](/assets/BookCover.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Delivering-Impossible-Successful-Software-Management/dp/B0FVDH4NJV/ref=sr_1_1?crid=350QMXX2JB8ME&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.wNytdDD3LgLSV6xP5GmyoUyX4DIWf8E9bnJDXTzaoE8MzqSN4buCmdokxljtZCWJXCcNSN2OaJkkcPy2K33wjN6WepK0dD4qohdRQXk3VkI_T-QZkbBwtLc9LKBa3f4yxaX31Zq6Z1LA2EDC_sZicl_4JzfaOKl-5WW_r0Gbk-Mul_iTnBSLgMW-rsULPL_AXpHNuwzDGEFUg1yKobfqtvqsdbM7cplVrcsTfIJGoJo.7Iqr6p6V_K69C-FvLWqvUXD5C4dU7xTIeRURqHT-O5Y&dib_tag=se&keywords=delivering+the+impossible&qid=1770189068&sprefix=delivering+the+impossib%2Caps%2C275&sr=8-1)

There's a temptation to think that project management is simple.

Despite all the evidence.

What evidence?

Projects run "late".

Projects end up being "over budget".

Sometimes projects aren't delivered at all.

Why does this keep happening again and again?

Because projects are far more complex than we imagine.

Because projects are far more uncertain than we imagine.

Because we instinctively see projects in ways that are unhelpful.

My book tries to help us see projects in more helpful ways.

Projects aren't just, or even mostly about delivering on initial promises.

Projects aren't really about delivering "exactly what it says on the tin."

Projects are about discovering value. 

Projects are about putting users in touch with that value.

If we think about projects in this way, we can deliver something useful and valuable.

Even in situations where delivering what was initially promised would be impossible.

I sat in an art gallery cafe this morning and wrote and wrote longhand. This is what Natalie Golberg recommends in ["Writing down the bones"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=writing+down+the+bones&adgrpid=194864520468&gad_source=1&hvadid=793537076054&hvdev=c&hvexpln=0&hvlocphy=1006993&hvnetw=g&hvocijid=2097827085952913688--&hvqmt=e&hvrand=2097827085952913688&hvtargid=kwd-295450082060&hydadcr=12124_2533441_7060&mcid=7d2ccd2de5fd3491a80804979356492f&tag=googhydr-21&ref=pd_sl_56r0uidc0e_e).

My experience is that it needs coupling with some good strategies for editing. Anyway long story short, I fleshed out the plot of an opera about project management.
