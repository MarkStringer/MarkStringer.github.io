What's the simplest way of explaning my book?

[![Delivering The Impossible](/assets/BookCover.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Delivering-Impossible-Successful-Software-Management/dp/B0FVDH4NJV/ref=sr_1_1?crid=350QMXX2JB8ME&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.wNytdDD3LgLSV6xP5GmyoUyX4DIWf8E9bnJDXTzaoE8MzqSN4buCmdokxljtZCWJXCcNSN2OaJkkcPy2K33wjN6WepK0dD4qohdRQXk3VkI_T-QZkbBwtLc9LKBa3f4yxaX31Zq6Z1LA2EDC_sZicl_4JzfaOKl-5WW_r0Gbk-Mul_iTnBSLgMW-rsULPL_AXpHNuwzDGEFUg1yKobfqtvqsdbM7cplVrcsTfIJGoJo.7Iqr6p6V_K69C-FvLWqvUXD5C4dU7xTIeRURqHT-O5Y&dib_tag=se&keywords=delivering+the+impossible&qid=1770189068&sprefix=delivering+the+impossib%2Caps%2C275&sr=8-1)

There's a temptation to think that project management is simple.

Despite all the evidence.

What evidence?

Projects run "late".

Projects end up being "over budget".

Sometimes projects aren't delivered at all.

Why does this keep happening again and again?

Because projects are far more complex than we imagine.

Because projects are far more uncertain than we imagine.

Because we instinctively see projects in ways that are unhelpful.

My book tries to help us see projects in more helpful ways.

Projects aren't just, or even mostly about delivering on initial promises.

Projects aren't really about delivering "exactly what it says on the tin."

Projects are about discovering value. 

Projects are about putting users in touch with that value.

If we think about projects in this way, we can deliver something useful and valuable.

Even in situations where delivering what was initially promised would be impossible.

## Sunday January 25th 2026
I sat in an art gallery cafe this morning and wrote and wrote longhand. This is what Natalie Golberg recommends in ["Writing down the bones"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=writing+down+the+bones&adgrpid=194864520468&gad_source=1&hvadid=793537076054&hvdev=c&hvexpln=0&hvlocphy=1006993&hvnetw=g&hvocijid=2097827085952913688--&hvqmt=e&hvrand=2097827085952913688&hvtargid=kwd-295450082060&hydadcr=12124_2533441_7060&mcid=7d2ccd2de5fd3491a80804979356492f&tag=googhydr-21&ref=pd_sl_56r0uidc0e_e).

My experience is that it needs coupling with some good strategies for editing. Anyway long story short, I fleshed out the plot of an opera about project management.
