# Mark Stringer

This is a single-page site. Edit **index.markdown** to change what appears here.

You can write in Markdown (like this paragraph), and drop images into the **/assets** folder.

---

## Add text

Just type. Markdown basics:

- **bold** with `**bold**`
- *italic* with `*italic*`
- links like `[my link](https://example.com)`

## Add an image

Use a file that’s already in `/assets`:

![A short description](/assets/BeachSmall.jpg)

Or with a caption:

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/BeachSmall.jpg" alt="A short description">
  <figcaption>A caption you can change.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Add sections

### A smaller heading
