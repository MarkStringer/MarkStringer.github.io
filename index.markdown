## Sunday January 25th 2026
I sat in an art gallery cafe this morning and wrote and wrote longhand. This is what Natalie Golberg recommends in ["Writing down the bones"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=writing+down+the+bones&adgrpid=194864520468&gad_source=1&hvadid=793537076054&hvdev=c&hvexpln=0&hvlocphy=1006993&hvnetw=g&hvocijid=2097827085952913688--&hvqmt=e&hvrand=2097827085952913688&hvtargid=kwd-295450082060&hydadcr=12124_2533441_7060&mcid=7d2ccd2de5fd3491a80804979356492f&tag=googhydr-21&ref=pd_sl_56r0uidc0e_e).

My experience is that it needs coupling with some good strategies for editing. Anyway long story short, I fleshed out the plot of an opera about project management.
