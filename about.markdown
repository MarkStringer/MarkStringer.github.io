![Mark Stringer Author Performer Project Manager](/assets/MarkStringerAuthorPerformerProjectManager.jpg)

Mark Stringer has worked in the software development industry for 30 years. He worked as a programmer, applications researcher and then, for the last fifteen years, as a project manager. He’s worked for companies such as IBM, Xerox and Cambridge University. 

He has wrote "Delivering the Impossible" because of a realisation. He seemed to be repeatedly reading the same book about project management, but with different titles. This book claimed that, if only you follow some prescribed methodology, everything would be lovely. His experience was, that no matter what methodology you used, things very often weren’t lovely at all.

In recent years, as well as writing this book, he has written and performed one-man shows – “Delivering the Impossible,” and "The Biscuit Tin and The Biscuit" at the Brighton and Edinburgh Festivals. 

He has an honours degree in philosophy from the University of St Andrews, Scotland.

He is married and lives in London, England and Thessaloniki, Greece.

His hobbies are learning Greek, joke writing and looking for his slippers.
